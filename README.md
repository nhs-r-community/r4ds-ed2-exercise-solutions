## {renv}

If you fork this repository to make changes that you wish to contribute via a pull request, just to help this repository uses {renv} and you will be prompted to use `renv::restore()` to restore the project library. This will ensure that your project has the same packages and versions as the contributors and this, in turn, helps to ensure that the GitHub Actions are stable to render the book automatically for when the merge request is accepted.
